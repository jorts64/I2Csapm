I2C slave arduino pro mini library

ESP8266 boards are great, specilly WeMos D1 board. But sometimes we need more I/O pins, analog inputs...
What about using a cheap Arduino pro mini as a I2C slave?
We can get one running at 3.3V, but only at 8MHz. Enough for us!

This library communicates with an arduino I2C slave that offers:
* 6 Analog inputs
* A matrix keypad
* A rotatory encoder
* A led

WORK in PROGRESS !
